          We open with the image of Christ at the well with the woman of Samaria. This is the Master Teacher himself, demonstrating love, individual attention, and spiritual insight in his teaching approach.

          Jesus Christ's example—how he taught, how he loved individuals, how he invited them to deeper truth—is the model for all teaching in the gospel. Every principle we discuss in this presentation flows from His perfect example.

          Come follow Him. Learn His way of teaching.

          Welcome to this presentation on teaching the gospel. We begin with President Nelson's powerful reminder about the necessity of the Holy Ghost in our lives.

          To magnify our opportunities to teach the gospel effectively, we need to focus on two key actions. This presentation explores the inspired tools available to us—particularly Preach My Gospel and Teaching in the Savior's Way—and how we can use them to strengthen our teaching and our testimonies.

While PMG <strong style="color: var(--church-gold); font-size: 1.05em;">revolutionized</strong> missionary work by replacing rigid scripts with Spirit-directed flexibility, TSW brought similar principles to all Church teaching settings.</div>
        <aside class="notes">
          These two manuals are the inspired tools President Nelson mentioned. They provide complementary approaches to gospel teaching—not competing resources, but parts of a unified teaching ecosystem.

          Whether you're a returned missionary, Sunday School teacher, parent, or anyone interested in effective gospel teaching, these principles apply to your context.

          We'll examine their key differences, core principles, and how to use both in magnifying our teaching opportunities.

        <aside class="notes">
          These four principles are the core of Teaching in the Savior's Way. They're not presented as sequential steps but as interconnected principles that work together.

          First, love those you teach. This is the foundation. Everything flows from genuine love for the people you're teaching. Know them, care about them, pray for them individually.

          Second, teach by the Spirit. This requires spiritual preparation. You need to prepare yourself spiritually before you even prepare the lesson. Invite the Spirit through prayer, personal study, and righteous living.

          Third, teach the doctrine. Use scriptures as your foundation. The doctrine you teach should be true and centered on Jesus Christ. While TSW emphasizes learner-centered facilitation, it doesn't mean being wishy-washy about doctrine.

          Fourth, invite diligent learning. This is about helping learners become responsible for their own learning journey. Ask questions that invite pondering. Create discussions. Help them see how gospel principles apply to their lives.

          These four principles work together. Love creates an environment where the Spirit can work. The Spirit guides both the teacher and the learner. The doctrine provides the content. And inviting diligent learning helps learners make the doctrine their own.

          Contrast this with PMG's framework, which is built on five gospel principles (Faith, Repentance, Baptism, Holy Ghost, Endure to the End). PMG focuses on doctrinal content; TSW focuses on teaching methodology.

              Why are we building temples at such an unprecedented pace? Why? Because the Lord has instructed us to do so. The blessings of the temple help to gather Israel on both sides of the veil.

          This quote from President Nelson captures the urgency and divine purpose of the Lord's work in these latter days. The temple stands as a central institution in preparing people for Christ's Second Coming—both for those living and for those on the other side of the veil.

          Both Preach My Gospel and Teaching in the Savior's Way serve this higher purpose: to invite all to come unto Christ, to deepen faith and discipleship, and to prepare a people who will help usher in the Second Coming.

          The Lord is indeed hastening His work, and as teachers—whether as missionaries or in Church settings—we have the privilege of being instruments in His hands.
